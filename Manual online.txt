Instruction manual


Use

Connect a mono audio output into the “Input” and the oscilloscope will immediately start measuring. There are 4 buttons. The “Hold” button freezes the screen.

With the “Select” button you can choose whitch meachure range you want to change.


Measuring

At the top of the display you will find the measure range for Voltage, Frequency Timing , Trigger Direction, RMS Voltage indication, Frequency measuring and average. On the left you will find the positive and negative voltage scale measurement.


Set schedule  

You can adjust the Voltage, Timing and Trigger by pressing the “Select” button. The underlined values at ​​the top of the display, indicates that it can be adjusted by pressing the “Up” or ”Down” buttons.  Set the range to maximize visibility for a clear and accurate reading.


Zero adjustment function  

If the waveform is not exactly at zero, it is possible to calibrate it to its zero point. Press “HOLD” to pause the waveform display, then press “SELECT” to auto-zero. The waveform fits to the zero position and is stored in the memory.
